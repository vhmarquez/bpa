<h1>Our Environment</h1>

<p>Over the past 30 years, America has overcome several different goals regarding issues on the environment. With the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act, people have taken a new stand on environmental protection. However, as time goes on, new sources of environmental danger will arise and pose a threat to society. In today’s world, there are plenty of issues regarding the environment. These issues need to be detained by maintaining the environment and taking affirmative action on the problems that persist.</p>

<p>With the dangers on the environment today, the health of living organisms is greatly at risk. So, remember to think twice before you leave your car engine running, throw that wad of paper on the ground, or even spray your lawn with pesticides. Be aware of the dangers in your environment and always remember: A healthier world is a happier world.</p>

<h2>Environmental Conservation</h2>

<p>The change in the climate is affected by the way people use energy. Some states, specifically New  York, offer tax incentives for environment-friendly buildings. These buildings are known as “Green Buildings” and they help increase energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Green buildings use resource-energy, water, materials, and land more efficiently and effectively and they provide healthier environments for working, learning and living. Green buildings also help developers save money by reducing construction costs and creating sustainable buildings. They also provide employees with a healthier indoor work environment by controlling outdoor air ventilation systems and using alternative paints, finishes, adhesives, furniture and fabrics that do not negatively affect the quality of the air.</p>
