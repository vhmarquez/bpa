<h2>What is the greenhouse effect?</h2>

<p>The greenhouse effect is actually a naturally-occurring effect that helps regulate the temperature of Planet Earth’s climate. By trapping heat and holding it in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect acts like a blanket; surrounding the earth and keeping it at ideal temperatures. However, too much of a good thing can be bad, and human-related activities creating too many greenhouse gasses, too quickly. As a result, we’re accelerating the greenhouse effect … warming both the planet and the atmosphere far beyond ideal temperatures, and far too quickly.</p>

<h2>Has global warming occurred in the past?</h2>

<p>Yes, it certainly has. The findings of scientists suggest that some three to four hundred thousand years ago, the average surface temperature of Planet Earth was sometimes as high as six degrees above, or as low as seventeen degrees below today’s average surface temperature. However, these changes were directly related to a variety of natural causes, including atmospheric particles from massive volcanic eruptions, and orbital variations changing the inclination of the Earth toward the sun. Sadly, today’s accelerating change in climate is primarily the result of unnatural or human, causes.</p>

<h2>What human activities are linked to global warming?</h2>

<p>The sad fact is that, because of our ecological connection to all life on the planet, almost everything contemporary human beings do has the potential to adversely affect the climate and contribute to global warming. The truth is that modern human beings have become lousy caretakers of Planet Earth. The damage is related to many sources: the burning of coal, oil and natural gas as well as deforestation and various agricultural and industrial practices.</p>

<h2>Why are trees part of the answer to global warming?</h2>

<p>Trees are important because they consume carbon dioxide and excrete oxygen, the latter element being particularly important to our existence. The former element, carbon dioxide, is also quite important, but not at the levels currently found in our atmosphere. The problem is that everyday we humans are burning or cutting down hundreds of square miles of our most important air purifiers and oxygen producers; trees.</p>

<h2>Plant more trees, and the problem is solved. Right?</h2>

<p>Planting more trees will help, but it is not a “fix-all,” and there is little chance we can plant enough trees in the near future to offset the worldwide devastation of forests. The climate change problem is critical enough that we need to look to green technologies for reducing our consumption of fossil fuels, including solar, wind, and geothermal generation of electricity. Planting trees will certainly help solve the problem, but it will not fix the problem on its own. </p>
