<h1>How I can help save the environment?</h1>
<h2>In Your Home and Yard – Conserving Energy &amp; Reducing Toxicity </h2>
<p>Keep air filters clean, Lower the thermostat on water heaters to 120, turn off unused equipment, Set your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38, your freezer at 0 to 5; unplug seldom used appliance, wash clothes with warm or cold water instead of hot, use a microwave instead of a conventional oven or stove, use fluorescent light bulbs, plant trees to shade your home. These are just several important ways to conserve energy. Use items that don’t contain mercury, household appliances that don’t use hazardous materials, test your home’s paint for lead, use traps instead of rat and mouse poisons or insect killers, avoid using dust-producing equipment, use an electric lawnmower instead of a gas one, leave grass clippings on the yard (they decompose and return nutrients to the soil), minimize pesticide use.</p>

<h2>In Your Office</h2>
<p>Copy or print on both sides of paper, reuse envelopes, folders, and paper clips; use mailer sheets for interoffice mail instead of envelopes, use a bulletin board for memos instead of sending them to each employee, use e-mail instead of paper communication, use recycled paper and discarded paper as scrap paper, print with soy-based inks (less toxic), and use ceramic coffee mugs instead of disposable cups.</p>

<h2>Protect the Air</h2>
<p>Recycle printer charges, shut off electrical equipment, report smoking vehicles to the air agency, don’t use your wood stove or fireplace when air quality is poor, avoid slow-burning smoldering fires, burn seasoned wood, use solar power, use water-based paints, purchase radial tires, paint with brushes or rollers instead of spray cans, barbecue with electric probes, don’t use old wooden stoves (before 1990), and if possible, walk or ride your bike instead of driving.</p>

<h2>Use Less Water</h2>
<p>Check and fix water leaks, install water-saving devices in faucets and toilets, don’t run water continuously, wash and dry only full loads of laundry and dishes, install low-flow shower heads, replace old toilets with newer ones (they use less water), turn off the washing machine’s water supply when not in use.</p>

<h2>Protect the Water</h2>
<p>Re-vegetate or mulch disturbed soil, never dump anything down storm drains, check your car for oil and other leaks, and take your car to a car wash instead of washing it in your driveway.</p>

<h2>Create Less Trash</h2>
<p>Buy items in bulk from loose bins (with less packaging), buy products that you can reuse, maintain and repair products instead of buying new ones, check reports for products that are easily repaired and have low breakdown rates, reuse bags and containers, use cloth napkins instead of paper ones as well as reusable plates and utensils, use containers to store food, shop with a canvas bag instead of paper or plastic ones, buy rechargeable batteries, use old newspaper for packaging material, compost your vegetable scraps, and buy used furniture.</p>
